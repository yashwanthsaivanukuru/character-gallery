    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="About Image">
    
    <p>This Character Gallery was created for the Sp26 Static Web App assignment. The theme of Superheroes was chosen to demonstrate how structured data (like universe, role, and power levels) can be displayed in a clean web format.</p>
    <p>The project uses basic HTML to create a multi-page experience, ensuring that users can navigate easily between the main gallery, deep-dive details, and the character submission form.</p>
